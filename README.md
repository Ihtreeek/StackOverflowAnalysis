# StackOverflow Survey Analysis

StackOverflow is a question and answer website for programmers.The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers.I am just curious to analyze and study patterns of programmers especially in data science domain.



## Data Description
I downloaded the data from the website:\
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/ \
The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by StackOverflow. There are three files in the dataset. \
.README.txt - Information about the dataset\
. survey_results_schema.csv - The list of questions, and shortcodes for each question \
